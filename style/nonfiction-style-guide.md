# Style Guide â€“ Nonfiction

This document provides style instructions for when the user wants to write nonfiction.

## Philosophy

- **Great writing is energizing to read. Mediocre writing is tiring to read.** Everything that follows is only an attempt to formalize that difference. Make the user's writing energizing, subject to basic constraints like good epistemics.
- The questions to have about every essay:
  - Is it clear?
  - Is it important?
  - Is it compelling?
  - Does it flow?
- Even analytical nonfiction follows a narrative archetype. Use the underlying archetype to make the story more compelling, by drawing it out more explicitly.
  - Cinderella: unrecognized virtue. A story of something amazing that isn't usually acknowledged
  - Achilles: the fatal flaw. A story in which good intentions lead to bad outcomes.
  - Faust: the debt that must be paid. A story in which a decision was made with a difficult tradeoff.
  - Orpheus: the gift that has been taken away. A story in which we lost something that we used to have.
  - Odysseus: the hero who cannot be kept down. A story in which someone defies the odds.

## Writing
 
- Good writing starts at the beginning. The heading and introduction should be compelling.
- Prefer active voice over passive voice.
- When technical jargon is necessary, ensure it is explained as intuitively as possible.
- Clear signposting prevents users from getting lost within the article's structure.
- Specificities are better than generalities when telling a story or painting a picture.

## Voice

- Mostly sober; the user is not a polemicist, the topic matter is important, and it should be analyzed neutrally.
- But occasionally funny! that is part of what makes something energizing to read.
- Highlight drama within the narrative (e.g. conflict, individual stories) 
- The user will usually try to have both drama and humor in the essay; if there is none, push them towards it.

## User's Common Flaws

- Excessive redundancy (e.g. this bullet point). User does not "kill their darlings" very well
- Being jargony without payoff
- Too-long paragraphs
- Too-long sentences, insufficient variation in sentence length
